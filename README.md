# Inferential-Statistics
## Overview
	This document outlines the analysis performed on three distinct datasets: foot injuries among football players, the breaking strength of gunny bags 	used for cement packaging, and the hardness of dental implants. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can inform decisions in sports 	medicine, quality control in packaging, and dental implant manufacturing.
## Contents
	Problem 1: Foot Injuries in Football Players
	Objective: 
		Analyze the relationship between player positions and foot injuries.
	Key Variables:
		Player positions (Striker, Forward, Attacking Midfielder, Winger).
		Injuries and non-injuries data.
	Key Questions Addressed:
		Probability of suffering an injury.
		Probability of being a Forward or Winger.
		Probability of being a Striker with an injury.
		Probability of an injured player being a Striker.
	Problem 2: Breaking Strength of Gunny Bags
	Objective: 
		Understand the distribution of breaking strength to minimize wastage and pilferage.
	Key Variables:
		Breaking strength (normally distributed with mean = 5 kg/cm², SD = 1.5 kg/cm²).
	Key Questions Addressed:
		Proportion of bags with breaking strength less than 3.17 kg/cm².
		Proportion with breaking strength at least 3.6 kg/cm².
		Proportion with breaking strength between 5 and 5.5 kg/cm².
		Proportion not between 3 and 7.5 kg/cm².
	Problem 3: Hardness of Stones for Printing
	Objective: 
		Assess the suitability of polished vs. unpolished stones for printing based on hardness.
	Key Variables:
		Brinell's hardness index.
	Key Questions Addressed:
		Suitability of unpolished stones for printing.
		Comparison of mean hardness between polished and unpolished stones.
	Problem 4: Hardness of Dental Implants
	Objective: 
		Analyze the factors affecting the hardness of dental implants.
	Key Variables:
		Hardness measurements based on different dentists and methods.
	Key Questions Addressed:
		Variation in hardness by dentist.
		Variation in hardness by method.
		Interaction effects between dentist and method on hardness.
## Data Analysis Steps
	Data Import and Structure Check
		Libraries imported and data loaded.
		Checked structure and types of data to ensure proper formatting.
	Missing Values Treatment
		Identified missing values in key columns where applicable.
		Used logical relationships or appropriate imputation methods to handle missing data.
	Statistical Summary
		Generated statistical summaries to understand distributions and central tendencies of numerical variables.
	Univariate Analysis
		Explored individual variables to identify trends and outliers.
	Bivariate Analysis
		Investigated relationships between numerical variables and between categorical vs. numerical variables.
	Hypothesis Testing
		Conducted hypothesis tests where necessary to draw conclusions about population parameters based on sample data.
## Conclusion
	The analyses conducted provide valuable insights into sports medicine, packaging quality control, and dental manufacturing processes. These insights 	can guide strategic decisions aimed at improving safety, reducing waste, and enhancing product quality across different sectors. This README file 	summarizes the objectives, methodologies, findings, and conclusions drawn from the analyses performed on the datasets provided. Adjustments can be 	made based on specific details or additional insights derived from your analysis.
